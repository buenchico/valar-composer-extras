# Valar Composer Extras

This Discourse theme component adds formatting options to your Discourse composer.

* underline
* strikethrough

These additions are responsive for desktops and phones, but not for horizon orientation or tablets. These additions have taken into consideration [Slick](https://github.com/discourse/Discourse-Slick-image-gallery), [Tiles](https://github.com/discourse/Discourse-Tiles-image-gallery), and [Events](https://github.com/angusmcleod/discourse-events) when determining what should be placed on the composer bar or in the composer pop out menu.

There is currently no implemented option for disabling particular buttons, but this can be done through CSS.

Forked from https://github.com/MonDiscourse/md-composer-extras to adjust to the needs of the valar.es community
